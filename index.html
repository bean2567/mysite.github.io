  <h1>My GitHub Website</h1>
  <p>This is my GitHub website. I created it using Bard, a large language model from Google AI.</p>
  <p>Bard is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.</p>
  <p>I hope you find Bard useful!</p>
